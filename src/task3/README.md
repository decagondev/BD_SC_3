# Task 3: String Manipulations

This package contains implementations for various string manipulation algorithms:

1. **Palindrome Check (Palindrome.java)**
   - Determines if a string is a palindrome
   - Includes options for case-sensitive and case-insensitive checks
   - Handles non-alphanumeric characters

2. **Character Count (CharCount.java)**
   - Counts the occurrence of each character in a string
   - Uses a HashMap to efficiently store and retrieve character counts

3. **Longest Word Finder (LongestWord.java)**
   - Finds the longest word in a sentence
   - Removes punctuation to handle real-world sentences

Each class contains:
- A main method for demonstration
- Test cases to validate functionality
- Well-documented methods with appropriate comments
