# Java Fundamentals Sprint Challenge

## Introduction
This Sprint Challenge focuses on fundamental Java programming concepts including loops, arrays, and pass-by-value behavior. You will demonstrate your understanding by implementing several key functions and algorithms.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Complete the implementation for each of the four tasks:
   - Task 1: Loop Patterns
   - Task 2: Array Operations
   - Task 3: String Manipulations
   - Task 4: Pass-by-value Demonstration
3. Test your implementations to ensure they work as expected
4. Commit and push your changes to your repository

## Task Details

### Task 1: Loop Patterns
Implement various loop patterns to generate specific outputs:
1. Create a triangular pattern using nested loops
2. Find all prime numbers below 100
3. Calculate the sum of digits in a number

### Task 2: Array Operations
Implement different array operations:
1. Reverse an array in-place without using additional data structures
2. Find the second largest element in an array
3. Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array

### Task 3: String Manipulations
Implement string manipulation algorithms:
1. Check if a string is a palindrome
2. Count the occurrence of each character in a string
3. Find the longest word in a sentence

### Task 4: Pass-by-value Demonstration
Demonstrate Java's pass-by-value behavior with both primitive and reference types:
1. Show that modifying a primitive parameter doesn't affect the original value
2. Show that modifying an object through a reference parameter affects the original object
3. Show that reassigning a reference parameter doesn't affect the original reference

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
1. Correctness - Does the code work as expected?
2. Code Quality - Is the code well-organized, readable, and properly commented?
3. Efficiency - Are the algorithms implemented efficiently?
4. Understanding - Does the implementation demonstrate understanding of core Java concepts?

## Time Guidelines
You have 3 hours to complete this Sprint Challenge. Plan your time accordingly:
- 10 minutes: Read instructions and plan your approach
- 30 minutes: Task 1 - Loop Patterns
- 45 minutes: Task 2 - Array Operations
- 45 minutes: Task 3 - String Manipulations
- 45 minutes: Task 4 - Pass-by-value Demonstration
- 15 minutes: Final review and submission

## How to Submit Your Sprint Challenge

1. Go to the Sprint Challenge section of the portal and select the Java Fundamentals Sprint Challenge
2. Input your GitHub repository link
3. Add links to any video files or supporting material, if required
4. Click the "Submit" button to finalize your Sprint Challenge submission

Good luck!
